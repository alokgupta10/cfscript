Replace:

cd /harness/cci_assessment_prep/
if [ -e requirements.txt ]; then
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

With:

echo "Searching for requirements.txt files in subdirectories..."
find /harness -type f -name "requirements.txt" | while read reqfile; do
  echo "Installing dependencies from: $reqfile"
  pip3 install -r "$reqfile"
done



⸻

Explanation:
	•	find /harness -type f -name "requirements.txt": searches all subdirectories under /harness for files named requirements.txt.
	•	while read reqfile: iterates over each found file.
	•	pip3 install -r "$reqfile": installs the dependencies from each file.

Optional: Add Logging

To keep things clean and track what’s being installed:

echo "==== Starting requirements installation ===="
find /harness -type f -name "requirements.txt" | while read reqfile; do
  echo "---- Installing from: $reqfile ----"
  pip3 install -r "$reqfile"
done
echo "==== All requirements installed ===="

Let me know if you want to skip certain subdirectories or handle requirements-dev.txt too.
