Thanks for the reminder — and yes, you're using *Amazon Linux 2023 (x86\_64), which is **not compatible* with the .rpm package you installed:

---

### ❌ What went wrong:

You installed:

bash
NessusAgent-10.9.0-amzn2.x86_64.rpm


This is built for *Amazon Linux 2, not **Amazon Linux 2023*.

As shown in your screenshots, there are *two different Nessus agents*:

* ✅ NessusAgent-10.9.0-amzn2.x86_64.rpm → for *Amazon Linux 2* on x86\_64
* ✅ NessusAgent-10.9.0-amzn2.aarch64.rpm → for *Amazon Linux 2 & 2023* on *Graviton (ARM)*

### ✅ What you actually need for Amazon Linux 2023 (x86\_64)

As of now, *Tenable does not provide an official RPM built for Amazon Linux 2023 x86\_64. However, you can try using the **RHEL 9-compatible* package instead:

#### 👉 Try this package:

bash
NessusAgent-10.9.0-el9.x86_64.rpm


Download from: [https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-agents](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-agents)

It supports:

> *Red Hat EL 9, **Alma Linux 9.5, **Rocky Linux 9, and likely works on **Amazon Linux 2023, which is based on **Fedora/RHEL 9*.

### ✅ Clean Reinstall Instructions:

sudo rpm -e NessusAgent


2. *Download the correct RPM:*

3. *Import the GPG Key:*

bash
sudo rpm --import https://downloads.tenable.com/tenable-gpg-keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-Tenable-4096


4. *Install the agent:*

Let me know once that’s done, and I’ll help you register the agent with Tenable.io or Tenable.sc if needed.
