Thank you—that’s exactly the clarity we need.

Since your containers rely on the .env_dev files being available before the app starts and you cannot modify the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml, the only reliable workaround before docker-compose up --build is:

Revised and Final Harness Step (Inject Before Docker Compose Build)

- step:
    name: Inject env_dev Before Build
    identifier: inject_env_before_build
    type: Run
    spec:
      shell: Sh
      command: |
        set -e

        echo ">>> Install Docker"
        apt update && apt install -y docker.io

        echo ">>> Create app directories and copy env_dev"
        mkdir -p ./app/orchestrator ./app/analyzer ./app/assessment

        cp ./app/env_dev ./app/orchestrator/env_dev
        cp ./app/env_dev ./app/analyzer/env_dev
        cp ./app/env_dev ./app/assessment/env_dev

        echo ">>> Verifying env_dev is in expected paths"
        find ./app -name "env_dev"

        echo ">>> Run docker-compose build with env already in place"
        docker-compose up -d --build

        echo ">>> Done"


⸻

Why this version will work:
	•	You ensure the file is already present before the containers are built and started.
	•	Since main.py uses load_dotenv() without a path, it expects env_dev to be in the app’s working directory (/usr/app/src/app/env_dev).
	•	This assumes Docker context includes ./app/... — and it should, based on your repo layout.

Let me know if your repo structure places the .env_dev in app/cci_analyzer/ or other submodules—I’ll adjust the cp path accordingly.
