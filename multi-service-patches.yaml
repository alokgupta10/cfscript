Perfect — below are separate patches.yaml files for each of your 5 services. You can place each one under a service-specific folder in your GitHub repo or Harness manifest section, depending on how you organize your setup.

✅ Now each microservice has its own patches.yaml that:
	•	Leaves your original deployment.yaml untouched
	•	Injects the dynamic image from Nexus at deploy time
	•	Is modular and easy to version in GitHub or per service in Harness

Let me know if you’d like me to generate full manifest folders (with these + base deployment.yaml/service.yaml) as a downloadable GitHub ZIP layout.
