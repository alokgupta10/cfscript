The error in your terminal screenshot is due to missing or outdated GPG keys for the Kali repository. Hereâ€™s how to fix it:

âœ… Step-by-step solution:

Run the following commands:

# Download and install the updated Kali Linux GPG key
curl -fsSL https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add the Kali repo with the correct signed-by option (replace <version> as needed)
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kali.list

# Then update again
apt update

ðŸ’¡ If gpg is not installed:

apt install gnupg -y

Let me know if youâ€™re not using Kali and the repo was added accidentally â€” we can remove it instead.
