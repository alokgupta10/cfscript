The error you're seeing in the terminal is related to **missing GPG keys** needed to verify the signature of the Kali Linux repository during `apt update`. Here's a clean fix for this:

---

### ‚úÖ **Problem**

```
Missing key: 827C5865F2511B0C7F7C1A3ED65462ECB5E4C5
```

This is the GPG key used to verify the repository. If it's missing, your system will **not trust the repository metadata**, hence `apt update` fails.

---

### ‚úÖ **Solution**

You need to **manually fetch and add the missing GPG key**:

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Step-by-step fix**

1. **Fetch the missing key from the keyserver**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install gnupg curl -y
   curl -fsSL https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

2. **Verify key installation (optional)**:

   ```bash
   gpg --show-keys /usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

3. **Update your repository config (if necessary)**:

   Check your `/etc/apt/sources.list` and ensure it looks like this:

   ```bash
   deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
   ```

4. **Update apt again**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

Let me know if you want help reviewing your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file or if `apt update` still throws warnings.
