Great! Since you have *WinSCP access, here's the **full process* to:

âœ… Download all CloudTrail, Insight, and Digest logs for us-east-1 in *May 2025*
âœ… Zip them on your *EC2 or CloudShell* instance
âœ… Transfer the zipped file to your *local Windows machine using WinSCP*

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step Instructions

### ðŸŸ© 1. *Run this script in your EC2 or AWS CloudShell terminal*

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set up
ACCOUNT_ID="567528144090"
BUCKET="acob-cloud-trial-user-behavior-and-mgmt-events"
BASE_S3_PATH="s3://${BUCKET}/AWSLogs/${ACCOUNT_ID}"
LOCAL_BASE=~/awslogs-may2025

# Create directories
mkdir -p "${LOCAL_BASE}/CloudTrail"
mkdir -p "${LOCAL_BASE}/CloudTrail-Insight"
mkdir -p "${LOCAL_BASE}/CloudTrail-Digest"

# Download logs
aws s3 cp "${BASE_S3_PATH}/CloudTrail/us-east-1/2025/05/" "${LOCAL_BASE}/CloudTrail/" --recursive
aws s3 cp "${BASE_S3_PATH}/CloudTrail-Insight/us-east-1/2025/05/" "${LOCAL_BASE}/CloudTrail-Insight/" --recursive
aws s3 cp "${BASE_S3_PATH}/CloudTrail-Digest/us-east-1/2025/05/" "${LOCAL_BASE}/CloudTrail-Digest/" --recursive

# Zip everything
cd ~
zip -r awslogs-may2025.zip awslogs-may2025/

echo "âœ… Done. Zip file created at ~/awslogs-may2025.zip"


---

### ðŸŸ© 2. *Transfer the File Using WinSCP*

#### ðŸ”¸ Steps:

1. Open *WinSCP*
2. Connect to your EC2 instance using:

   * *Host*: your EC2 Public IP
   * *Username*: usually ec2-user (or ubuntu for Ubuntu)
   * *Private key file*: the .pem file you use for SSH access
3. Once connected, navigate to home/ec2-user (or your user home)
4. Find the file: awslogs-may2025.zip
5. *Drag and drop* to your Windows machine

---

## âœ… Result:

* You now have *all CloudTrail logs (standard, insight, digest)* from *us-east-1 / May 2025* in a single .zip file on your local machine.

Let me know if you want to script the reverse â€” upload from local to another bucket â€” or extract/analyze the logs.
